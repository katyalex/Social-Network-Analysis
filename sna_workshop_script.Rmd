Brief introduction into R Network analysis
```{r}
library(sna)
library(xlsx)
library(statnet)
library(igraph)
```

Data analysis
1. Data representation
Network data in R could be represented in the form of 
1) adjacency matrices 
2) nodes with attributes
```{r}
setwd("D:\\KSHAP DATA\\busan_workshop")
mat = read.csv('w1mat.csv', header = T,row.names=1)
node = read.xlsx('w1node.xlsx', sheetIndex = 1) #attributes of the nodes (sex, age, education, mmse, cesd)
node = node[1:7]
head(node)
```
Create graph object to analyze. First tell R that mat file is a matrix, then call function as.network to turn it into network object for the further analysis. 
```{r}
m2 = as.matrix(mat)
net = as.network(m2)
```
Brief stats with network.
First it is necessary to assign attributes to nodes in the network. In case of KSHAP it is age, level of depression (cesd) and sex.
```{r}
list.network.attributes(net)
set.network.attribute(net, 'age', node$age)
set.network.attribute(net,'cesd', node$cesd_c)
set.network.attribute(net, 'sex', node$sex)
list.network.attributes(net)
```
3.3 Description and Visualization
<p>Next are common characteristics of the graph.</p>
<p>Directed means whether relationships are directed or not. Loops mean if somebody pointed on himself (rarely possible with social network)</p>
```{r}
net # Get an overall summary
```

```{r}
network.dyadcount(net) # How many dyads in network?
network.edgecount(net) # How many edges are present?
network.size(net) # How large is the network?
```
Next function gives a brief image of the network object. It is possible to customize plot to make it look niecer.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c( 1, 2 ))
plot(net,displaylabels=F) # Plot with names
gplot(m2) # gplot Will work with a matrix object too
```

```{r}
#To get more info
?summary.network #summary on the whole network
?network.dyadcount
?network.edgecount 
?as.sociomatrix #network in the form of square matrix
?is.directed #Boolean: whether network is directed or not
?ego.extract() #Extract Egocentric Networks from Complete Network Data
```

Simple descriptive statistic on the whole network. 

```{r}
gden(net) # density of the whole network
grecip(net, measure = 'edgewise') # proportion of relations that are symmetric (how many pairs of people pointed to each other)
gtrans(net) # transitivity
connectedness(net)

#number of isolates in a graph
length(isolates(net))
```
Dyad and triad census
Dyad.census function retrievs a matrix with 3 columns of mutual, assymetric and  null dyads for the graph.
Triad.census function retrievs a matrix with 16 columns (each column for possible triad form;)
<center> ![](D:\\KSHAP DATA\\busan_workshop\\triad.jpg) </center> 

```{r}

sna::dyad.census(net) 
sna::triad.census(net)
```

1. Centrality measures: in-degree and out-degree centrality
<p>P.S. Packages sna and igraph in R contain identical functions (e.g. degree), so if both packages are now in the work space, it is neccessary specify the package from which the function is used by adding "sna::" before function.</p>
```{r}
outdegree = sna::degree(net, cmode = "outdegree" )
indegree = sna::degree(net, cmode = 'indegree')
degreeall = sna::degree(net, cmode = 'freeman')
par(mfrow = c( 1, 2 ))
hist( outdegree )
hist(indegree)
quantile(outdegree)
mean(degreeall)
```


2. Embeddedness: k-core score 
```{r}
kcore = kcores(net)
table(kcore)
mean(kcore)
hist(kcore, xlab = 'K-core score')
```

3. Brokerage (computed from package igraph): Burt's constraint measure
```{r}
net2 = graph_from_adjacency_matrix(m2)
constraint = constraint(net2)
hist(constraint, xlab = 'Social constraint')
```

```{r}
node$constraint=constraint
head(node)
```

```{r}
node$cesd = as.numeric(node$cesd_c)
m1 = lm(cesd ~ age+sex+constraint, data = node, na.action = na.exclude)
summary(m1)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
pred = predict(m1)
ggplot(node, aes(x = node$constraint, y = pred)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = pred), shape = 1)+geom_point(col = 'steelblue', size=1)+ geom_smooth(method="lm",col="firebrick")+xlab("Constraint") + ylab("Predicted values of loneliness")+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1.2, 0.2))   # Add the predicted values
```

Network vizualization (igraph package)
```{r}
net2 = set.vertex.attribute(net2, 'age',index = V(net2), value = node$age)
net2 = set.vertex.attribute(net2, 'cesd', value = node$cesd)
net2 = set.vertex.attribute(net2, 'sex',value = node$sex)
```

```{r}
list.vertex.attributes(net2)
```

On the next graph it can be seen that there is kind of gender segregation among respondents in the village. Red color represents women, and blue color - men. 
```{r}
sex = node$sex+1
colrs = c('red','steelblue')
V(net2)$color = colrs[sex]
V(net2)$size <- kcore1*0.8
V(net2)$frame.color = 'black'
lay1 = layout_nicely(net2)
pl1 = plot(net2, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size=0.1, layout = lay1)
```

This graph represents in color the amount of depression among respondents!
```{r}
lonely1 = node$cesd+2
colrs = brewer.pal(9, 'Blues')
V(net2)$color = colrs[lonely1]
V(net2)$size <- 4
V(net2)$frame.color = 'black'
lay1 = layout_nicely(net2)
pl1 = plot(net2, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size=0.1, layout = lay1)
```
